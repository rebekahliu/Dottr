### Flick

## Overview

Flick will be a game based on asteroids. There will be different colored dots moving around the board. 
The player will navigate their ship to "eat" the dots that matches it color and avoid the ones that don't.
If the player hits a dot that doesn't match their color they will lose a life. Dots will respawn as the 
player eats them. Every 5 seconds or so the player ship color will change to match a different color of dots.

There will be two game modes, a timed one to see how many points the player can get and a zen mode where the
player can keep going until they lose.
