# Dottr

### Game

Player controls the ship using their cursor. The goals of the game is to "eat" the dots that match the ships's color and avoid the ones that do not. Every 4 dots that are consumed the ship's color will change and the player will now chase after a different set of dots.

Players start off with one life. When they collide with a dot of a different color the game is over. The instructions are replaced by the final score and a button to restart the game.

## Future plans

Implement a backend using Node/Express.js to save player scores and display a leaderboard.
